# Python-OOP-practice
Sure, here are some exercises that you can practice to improve your OOP, constructor, encapsulation, and polymorphism skills:

Create a class Person with attributes name, age, and address. Use encapsulation to make these attributes private and provide getter and setter methods for each attribute.

Create a class Student that inherits from the Person class. Add a new attribute student_id to the Student class. Also, override the display() method of the Person class in the Student class to include the student_id.

Create a class Shape with attributes length and width. Provide a constructor that initializes these attributes. Add a method area() that calculates and returns the area of the shape.

Create a class Rectangle that inherits from the Shape class. Add a method perimeter() that calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

Create a class Circle that inherits from the Shape class. Add a new attribute radius to the Circle class. Override the area() method of the Shape class to calculate and return the area of the circle. Also, add a method circumference() that calculates and returns the circumference of the circle.

Create a class Animal with a method speak() that prints a message saying that the animal is speaking. Create two subclasses Dog and Cat that override the speak() method to print a message saying that the dog or cat is barking or meowing respectively.

Create a class BankAccount with attributes balance and interest_rate. Provide a constructor that initializes these attributes. Add methods deposit() and withdraw() that modify the balance attribute. Add a method add_interest() that adds interest to the account based on the interest_rate attribute.

Create a class CheckingAccount that inherits from the BankAccount class. Override the withdraw() method to include a fee of $1 for every withdrawal.

Create a class SavingsAccount that inherits from the BankAccount class. Override the add_interest() method to add interest to the account based on a monthly interest rate instead of an annual interest rate.

Create a class Car with attributes make, model, and year. Provide a constructor that initializes these attributes. Add a method drive() that prints a message saying that the car is being driven. Create a subclass ElectricCar that overrides the drive() method to print a message saying that the electric car is being driven silently.
